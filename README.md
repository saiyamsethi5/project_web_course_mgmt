INSTRUCTIONS:
- To launch the program - open the Index.html file with a browser of your choice

MODES:
- Add-Modify Courses: Allows enrollment and modification of offered courses
- Course History: Displays a view of all completed (past) courses
- View Timetable: Displays a graphical time table of enrolled courses

INTERACTION (IMPORTANT):
- Please aim to use maximum window space when using the program. This will help avoid the technical constraint of overlapping objects.

- The program is strictly set-up to simulate the experience for one user. See details below.

Most courses in the 'Add-Modify Courses' screen prevent enrollment. This is visible in the 'Status' column and is marked with a red 'X'.
These preventions are legitimate constraints such as:
- Course Credit Already Received: occurs when the user already has the course credit.
- Course Seats Unavailable: occurs when no seats are open in the course.
- Already Enrolled in Course: occurs when the course is already selected
- Course Conflict: The following course conflicts exist and are available for adjustment (selecting alternative core) when enrolling
  - Fall 2017: MECHT 4XB3 and MAGIC 4RF3 (Core Conflict)
  - Winter 2017: ENVIR 1QQ3 and MATHS 1EM3 (Core Conflict)

All other courses marked with a green checkmark are available for enrollment. Enrolled courses can be deleted or modified from the same screen.
Modifications are strictly limited to Core, Tutorial, and Lab timings (subject to availability);
